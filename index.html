    <h1>The Lord of the Rings: A Tale of Middle-earth</h1>
    <p>
        In the land of <strong>Middle-earth</strong>, a place of ancient forests, towering mountains, and vast plains,
        there
        existed a ring of unimaginable power. This ring, known as the <strong>One Ring</strong>, was forged by the Dark
        Lord
        <strong>Sauron</strong> in the fires of <strong>Mount Doom</strong>. It held the power to control all other
        rings of
        power and enslave the free peoples of Middle-earth. But the ring was lost for centuries, until it came into the
        hands of a humble hobbit named <strong>Bilbo Baggins</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>Chapter 1: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
    <p>
        The story begins in the peaceful Shire, home to the hobbits. Bilbo Baggins, now old and weary, decides to leave
        the
        Shire and entrusts the One Ring to his young nephew, <strong>Frodo Baggins</strong>. <span
            class="spoiler">Unbeknownst to Frodo, the ring is a dangerous burden, for Sauron has risen again and seeks
            to
            reclaim it.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Frodo is visited by the wise wizard <strong>Gandalf</strong>, who reveals the true nature of the ring. <span
            class="spoiler">Gandalf warns Frodo that the ring must be destroyed to prevent Sauron from conquering
            Middle-earth.</span> Together, they form a plan to take the ring to the elven haven of
        <strong>Rivendell</strong>, where the fate of the ring will be decided.
    </p>
    <p>
        Along the way, Frodo is joined by his loyal friends: <strong>Samwise Gamgee</strong>, <strong>Merry
            Brandybuck</strong>, and <strong>Pippin Took</strong>. They face many dangers, including the terrifying
        <strong>Ringwraiths</strong>, servants of Sauron who hunt Frodo to reclaim the ring. <span class="spoiler">Frodo
            is
            wounded by a Ringwraith's blade, but he is healed by the elf <strong>Arwen</strong>, who takes him to
            Rivendell.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        In Rivendell, a council is held to decide the fate of the ring. Representatives from all the free peoples of
        Middle-earth—elves, dwarves, men, and hobbits—gather to discuss the growing threat of Sauron. <span
            class="spoiler">It is decided that the ring must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom, where it was
            forged.</span> A fellowship is formed to aid Frodo in his quest: <strong>Gandalf</strong>,
        <strong>Aragorn</strong>, <strong>Legolas</strong>, <strong>Gimli</strong>, <strong>Boromir</strong>, and
        Frodo's
        hobbit friends.
    </p>

    <h3>Chapter 2: The Two Towers</h3>
    <p>
        The fellowship sets out on their journey, but they are soon pursued by Sauron's forces. <span class="spoiler">In
            the
            Mines of Moria, they are attacked by orcs and a fearsome Balrog. Gandalf sacrifices himself to save the
            group,
            falling into the abyss with the Balrog.</span> The remaining members of the fellowship continue their
        journey,
        grieving the loss of their leader.
    </p>
    <p>
        As they travel, the fellowship begins to fracture. <span class="spoiler">Boromir, tempted by the ring's power,
            tries
            to take it from Frodo. Frodo and Sam decide to continue the quest alone, while the others are separated in
            the
            chaos.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, <strong>Merry</strong> and <strong>Pippin</strong> are captured by orcs but are rescued by the
        ancient
        tree-like creatures known as <strong>Ents</strong>. <span class="spoiler">The Ents, led by
            <strong>Treebeard</strong>, decide to join the fight against Sauron and attack his stronghold of
            Isengard.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the orcs to rescue Merry and Pippin. Along the way, they encounter the
        <strong>Riders of Rohan</strong>, a group of skilled horsemen led by <strong>King Théoden</strong>. <span
            class="spoiler">They help Rohan defend against an attack by Sauron's forces, led by the treacherous
            <strong>Saruman</strong>.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>Chapter 3: The Return of the King</h3>
    <p>
        As the war against Sauron intensifies, Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mount Doom. They are joined by
        <strong>Gollum</strong>, a former ring-bearer who is both a guide and a threat. <span class="spoiler">Gollum's
            obsession with the ring leads him to betray Frodo, but his actions ultimately play a crucial role in the
            ring's
            destruction.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the climactic battle at <strong>Minas Tirith</strong>, the forces of Gondor and Rohan unite to defend against
        Sauron's army. <span class="spoiler">Aragorn reveals himself as the rightful heir to the throne of Gondor and
            leads
            the charge against the enemy.</span> The battle is fierce, but the free peoples of Middle-earth prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
        Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom. <span class="spoiler">Frodo, overwhelmed by the ring's power, claims
            it
            for himself. But Gollum attacks him, biting off Frodo's finger and reclaiming the ring. In his triumph,
            Gollum
            falls into the fires of Mount Doom, destroying the ring and Sauron's power forever.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        With the ring destroyed, Sauron is defeated, and peace returns to Middle-earth. Aragorn is crowned king of
        Gondor,
        and the hobbits return to the Shire as heroes. <span class="spoiler">Frodo, however, is deeply scarred by his
            journey and decides to leave Middle-earth, sailing to the Undying Lands with the elves.</span>
